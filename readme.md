# AutoReferee

> Plugin for automatically running competitive Minecraft matches.

- Remake of [rmct/AutoReferee](https://github.com/rmct/autoreferee)
- Built for [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) (`1.8.8`), I cannot guarantee functionality with other Minecraft APIs
- Map development functionality requires [WorldEdit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldedit) (`6.1.5` recommended)
